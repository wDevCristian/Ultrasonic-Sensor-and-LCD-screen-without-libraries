# Ultrasonic Sensor and LCD screen without libraries on Arduino

### Components:  
Arduino: Uno R3 ATmega328P  
Ultrasonic Sensor: HC-SR04  
LCD Screen: 16x2 LCD displays with the Hitachi HD44780 driver (16 pin version)  

### What is the purpose of this project?  
The project is meant to enhance the comprehension of how does an LCD screen and the Ultrasonic sensor work, by controlling them "through the wires".
